# THIS PIECE OF SOFTWARE IS NO LONGER DEVELOPED

Reference implementation implementation of a [Speaco] server. It
supports all of the features of the client but lacks non-LAN features
such as spam protection and encryption.

[Speaco]: https://github.com/kirbykevinson/speaco-client

## How to run

First, install the dependecies the server needs:

```
npm install .
```

Then, launch the server on the needed host and port (127.0.0.1:6942 by
default):

```
node . [host] [port]
```
